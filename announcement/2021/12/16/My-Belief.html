    <p>In early this July I wanted to start a blog and chose Jekyll as the framework to begin with.

<p>As a new-born project it will inevitably have problems and defects. The development will be a progressive process and continuous effort will be devoted to improve the quality and add new features. If you found a bug or have features request, please donâ€™t hesitate to raise an issue, or even better if you want to create a PR, it is always welcomed!</p>
